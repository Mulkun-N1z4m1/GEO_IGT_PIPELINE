This may not be applicable at first because I would be actively modifying this project for the government strategical "Integrasi Geospasial Tematik (IGT)"
I used Multimodal AI such as Gemma-3 27B to do the weighting-process based on current context to approximate real-time relevan weighting context
Then, I used the Geo lib-packages to contribute to the Graph-Network Algorithms
Others would be necessarily added
